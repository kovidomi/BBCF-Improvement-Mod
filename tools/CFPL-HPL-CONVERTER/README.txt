CFPL-HPL-CONVERTER (v1.00) by KoviDomi -- README
==========================

HPL to CFPL 
==============
- Place the .hpl files into the folder
- HPL files must have the same naming convention as in BBCFIM:
    - Effect files must end with the naming convention of "_effectXX.hpl". Where XX is the index of the effect file. 
    - For example, if you have a .hpl file named "MakotoBlue.hpl", then in the same palette folder a .hpl file named "MakotoBlue_effect01.hpl" will be used as that palette's first effect, and a file named "MakotoBlue_effect06.hpl" will be used as sixth, etc.
    - A file created with its name ending with "_effectbloom.hpl" will turn on the bloom effect for that custom palette in the game.
- A character template .cfpl file is needed to be put in the folder, they can be found in the template folder
- Run 'CFPL-HPL-CONVERTER.exe'
